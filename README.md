# Sentiment Analysis of Women's Clothing E-Commerce Reviews

This repository is the home of a machine learning project aimed at analyzing sentiments in customer reviews for a women's clothing e-commerce platform. The project leverages the natural language processing capabilities of three neural network architectures: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN).

## Project Overview

Customer reviews are rich with insights, and sentiment analysis is a powerful tool to unlock these. This project seeks to automate the sentiment classification process using advanced machine learning models, which could be pivotal for businesses looking to understand customer sentiment at scale.

## Directory Structure

- `/data`: The raw and processed datasets used in the analysis.
- `/models`: Serialized versions of the trained models and their respective training scripts.
- `/notebooks`: Detailed Jupyter notebooks illustrating the methodologies and findings.
- `/src`: The source code for the project, including data preprocessing, model training, and inference scripts.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of thousands of customer reviews, each with several attributes, such as review text, ratings, and more. It has been preprocessed to facilitate the machine learning models effectively.


## Usage

 launch the Jupyter notebooks to follow the analysis:
