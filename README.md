# Sentiment Analysis of Women's Clothing E-Commerce Reviews


## üìã Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning project focused on sentiment analysis of customer reviews from a women's clothing e-commerce platform. The project implements and compares three different neural network architectures: **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**, **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**, and **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)** to classify customer sentiment.

### üéØ Objective

The primary goal is to automate sentiment classification of customer reviews, which can provide valuable insights for businesses to understand customer satisfaction at scale and make data-driven decisions to improve their products and services.
